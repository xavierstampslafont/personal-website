        <p>
          When I was in college, I spent a good deal of time thinking about what
          I want to do with my life. My thoughts were filled with video games.
          You see, I grew up during a great time in games, the late SNES era and
          the PSX era. In particular, the JRPG genre captivated me â€“ Japanese
          role-playing games (e.g. Final Fantasy). I decided to get into music
          so I could work in games. This led to my majoring in music with an
          emphasis in composition, as well as my other major in Japanese
          language and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further down the line, I found that I would likely need a master's
          degree in order to work in the industry. It felt risky to spend an
          entire degree on something more specialized like this. However, I
          strongly believe in living a life without regrets. I was <i>not</i>{" "}
          interested in getting to 80 years old and regretting that I never
          tried to get into games. So I moved to Denmark for this graduate
          program in game development, one of the few programs in Europe that
          offered an actual game design line.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I completed my studies, I worked a tech support job for a year,
          after which I received a job offer at one of Denmark's larger and more
          popular game studios. I accepted the offer and worked there for nearly
          5 years. During my time in Denmark, I also met Ashley, who is stellar.
          We later married and had a baby. So my gamble worked out very well in
          more ways than one!
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I was subject to one of the harsh realities of the game
          industry. Within a year of moving to another one of Denmark's more
          well known game studios, I was part of a mass layoff. I decided that I
          and my family deserve more stability than what the industry was known
          for. Fortunately, I had become a good developer and great teammate. I
          found another job as a developer outside of the game industry, and I
          haven't looked back since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make no mistake, I'm still very much interested in making games!
          However, this interest is now a hobby. The only difficulty is it
          competes with my other interests: improving as a software developer,
          writing music, <i>playing</i> games, making comics... the list goes
          on!

          Wow, you sat through all of that! Thank you. Now check out my other
