                  As a programmer, my mission is to create long-term value
                  through code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My main tools for achieving this are clean code, refactoring,
                  TDD.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love writing scripts and reusable code components which
                  improve development quality and speed!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm team oriented, with high consideration for my colleaguesâ€™
                  well-being.
                </p>
